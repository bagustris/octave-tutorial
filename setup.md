You will need to install [GNU Octave][gnu-octave] to do this lesson.

You will also need to download some data, which we will analyze using Octave:

1.  Make a new folder in your `/home/username/` called `octave-novice-inflammation` by steps below (2~4).
2.  Download [octave-novice-inflammation-data.zip](https://github.com/bagustris/octave-tutorial/raw/gh-pages/data/octave-novice-inflammation-data.zip) and move the file to this folder.
3.	If itâ€™s not unzipped yet, double-click on it to unzip it; this will place all the data in the `octave-novice-inflammation` directory.
4.	You can access this folder from the Unix shell with:

~~~
cd /home/Username/octave-novice-inflammation/data
~~~
{: .bash}
