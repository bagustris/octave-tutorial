You will need to install [GNU Octave][gnu-octave] to do this lesson.

You will also need to download some data, which we will analyze using Octave:

1.  Make a new folder in your `/home/username/` called `octave-novice-inflammation` by steps below (2 OR 3).
2.  Download [octave-novice-inflammation-data.zip](https://github.com/bagustris/octave-tutorial/raw/gh-pages/data/octave-novice-inflammation-data.zip) and extract it (right click > extract here, on Ubuntu), OR:
3.	Run the following commands on terminal,
~~~
$ wget https://github.com/bagustris/octave-tutorial/raw/gh-pages/data/octave-novice-inflammation-data.zip
$ unzip octave-novice-inflammation-data.zip -d octave-novice-inflammation-data 
~~~
{: .bash}
4.	You can access this folder from the Unix shell with:

~~~
cd /home/Username/octave-novice-inflammation-data
