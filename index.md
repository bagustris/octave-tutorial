> ## GNU Octave
>
> [GNU Octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) is a free and open-source alternative
> to MATLAB which shares its syntax ([see more about compatibility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Octave#MATLAB_compatibility)). 

Kita menggunakan Octave/Matlab karena beberapa hal berikut:
1. we have to use *something* for examples;
2. it's well-documented;
3. it has a large (and growing) user base among scientists in academia and industry; and
4. it has a large library of packages available for performing diverse tasks.
